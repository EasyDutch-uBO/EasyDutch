## [EasyDutch](https://github.com/EasyDutch-uBO/EasyDutch)
The updated version of EasyList Dutch special for uBlock Origin. 

This filterlist has been made because the EasyList Dutch filter isn't maintained often. <br>
So I made this to provide you a better service!! <br>
This list also handles anti-adblock, which isn't done by EasyList Dutch. See these comments for more information: <br>
[easylist/easylistdutch#11 (comment)](https://github.com/easylist/easylistdutch/issues/11#issuecomment-818864565) and [easylist/easylistdutch#30 (comment)](https://github.com/easylist/easylistdutch/issues/30#issuecomment-1011180477).

If you see ads on dutch websites please [report](https://github.com/EasyDutch-uBO/EasyDutch/issues/new/choose) it to me or sent me an email to easydutch.adblock@gmail.com <br>

> ##### Ordering of filters
> 
> New filters must be added on the top of each list.
> 
> The reason is to provide an easy way to check whether a filter is still relevant. The filters at the end of the file will be the oldest filters, and also the most likely to maybe be obsolete.
> 
> Old filters which are confirmed to still be required must be moved to the top of the list.
> 
> ##### Issue number association
> 
> **All** added filters must be associated with a formal issue number or date, example:
> 
>     ! https://github.com/EasyDutch-uBO/EasyDutch/issues/3
>     ||data.inertanceretinallaurel.com^
>     ! 2021-04-27
>     ||androidplanet.nl,iphoned.nl##.dynamic-content-native
> 
> This way we know why a filter was added, and how to verify whether an old filter is still needed. The comment line preceding the filter(s) to solve a specific issue should be only a URL to the issue. The issue itself can contains all the details about how the issue was solved, and why it was solved this way, etc.
> 
> ##### Commit message
> 
> - Keep it simple, use `A:` for adding a site, `C:` for changing or updating rules, `R:` for removing, and `M:` for moving to other files. 
> - Put here after the site url `spele.nl` (no `https://www.`) 
> - Put after this the issue number. </br>
> Example: `A: spele.nl fix #3` or `C: nu.nl`. The issue itself will contains all the details.
> 
> ##### Hide General
> 
> You may only make General Hiding rules, if it applies to tree or more websites
> *******
> #### What you might do or not do as a contributor
> 
> As a contributor it is **forbidden** to change the following files:
> - `.github` folder 
> - `README.md`
> - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
> - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
> - `LICENSE`
> 
> The rest you may change.
> 
> Breaching this rule will result in a warning and if not listening, being banned as contributor!
